"a total of 280 arrowheads subdivided into nine chronologically distinct phases (I: 3700–3600 B C; II: 3450 BC; III: 3200 IV: 3100 BC; V: 3050–3010 BC; VI: 3010–2930 BC; VII: 2850–2750 BC; VIII: 2750–2600 BC; IX: 2600–1650 BC) defined by Saintot (1998). For each phase, we counted the number of arrowheads assigned to twenty distinct types, each defined as a unique combination of a binary presence-absence of morphological traits based on a paradigmatic classification (see Electronic Supplement Table 2) that excludes size and material. In this study we chose to analyse the arrowheads at the aggregated type scale of analysis instead of individual trait-level of analysis, for a closer comparison with Saintot's original analysis."
